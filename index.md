    <p>Whether it’s posing and commentating or filming and cropping, I’ve gravitated towards a camera for its ability to capture fleeting moments. I’ve always loved how photos can tell so much yet can leave so many questions. The photo’s story is told almost entirely by those who perceive it. The before and after are filled in by perspective without being given a chance to add context. One photo can tell a million stories. As a child, I found myself doing more than just playing with cameras, I was capturing moments that left an imprint on me. Documenting through photos meant slowing down, getting together, and paying attention with those around. As times change, so has the power of the camera. The magnitude of the camera continues to shift the way we understand joy, grief, and connection in a turbulent climate.
My work in photography focuses on how people express joy in times of uncertainty. I aim to capture the moments of celebration that exist alongside tension and instability. My goal  is for my photos to feel like a familiar invitation and a moment of reflection. Through experimenting with different techniques I hope to highlight the diverse forms joy comes in.
